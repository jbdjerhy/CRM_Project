### 1. **Project Setup**
   - **Environment Setup:**
     - Install Python and a code editor like VS Code or PyCharm (Community Edition).
     - Set up a virtual environment for your project.
     - Install necessary Python packages like Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Mail using `pip`.
   - **Version Control:**
     - Install Git and create a GitHub repository for version control.
     - Initialize Git in your project directory and make regular commits as you develop the project.

### 2. **Web Form Development**
   - **Frontend:**
     - Create a simple web form using HTML and CSS to capture lead information like name, contact details, and insurance needs.
   - **Backend:**
     - Use Flask to handle form submissions. When a user submits the form, Flask will process the data on the server side.
   - **Validation:**
     - Implement basic data validation on the frontend (e.g., ensuring required fields are filled) and backend (e.g., ensuring data types are correct).

### 3. **Database Integration**
   - **Database Setup:**
     - Choose SQLite for simplicity, as it’s a file-based database and doesn’t require installation.
   - **Database Models:**
     - Define the database schema, such as tables for storing leads, using SQLAlchemy.
   - **Data Submission:**
     - Capture the form data and store it in the SQLite database.

### 4. **Data Management and Processing**
   - **CRUD Operations:**
     - Implement basic functionality to create, read, update, and delete lead records in the database.
   - **Data Validation:**
     - Ensure that data entered is of the correct type and handle any missing data appropriately before storing it.
   - **Lead Status Management:**
     - Develop a system to assign and update lead statuses, such as "New," "Worked," "Stale," and "Critical," based on time and interaction.

### 5. **Notification System**
   - **Email Notifications:**
     - Use Flask-Mail or another free Python email library to send notifications when leads reach certain statuses or age milestones.
   - **Scheduling Alarms:**
     - Use a simple scheduling tool like `schedule` to run periodic checks on lead statuses and trigger email notifications.

### 6. **Access Control**
   - **User Authentication:**
     - Implement basic user authentication using Flask-Login, allowing users to log in and access the CRM securely.
   - **Role-Based Access Control:**
     - Set up user roles, such as Admin and Agent, and restrict access to certain features or data based on these roles.

### 7. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - **Error Handling:**
     - Develop mechanisms to handle common errors, such as database connection issues or invalid form submissions, providing user-friendly messages.
   - **Logging:**
     - Set up a basic logging system to keep track of application activities and errors, which can be useful for debugging.

### 8. **Testing and Deployment**
   - **Unit and Integration Tests:**
     - Write simple tests to check that individual parts of your application work correctly. Use Python’s built-in `unittest` framework.
   - **Deployment:**
     - Since the project will be deployed locally, package your application so it can run on any local machine. Use tools like `pyinstaller` if needed.

### 9. **User Interface and Experience**
   - **Dashboard:**
     - Create a simple dashboard where users can view and manage leads, with filters and search capabilities.
   - **Reports:**
     - Implement a feature to generate basic reports, like lead status summaries, and export them as CSV files.
   - **User Feedback:**
     - Plan for gathering feedback from users on what works well and what could be improved, then iterate on the design.

### 10. **Maintenance and Iteration**
   - **Monitoring:**
     - Regularly monitor your application for any issues or improvements.
   - **Regular Updates:**
     - As you learn more and gather feedback, continue to improve and add features to your CRM.
