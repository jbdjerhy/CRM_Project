### Detailed Step-by-Step Plan for Agent Assignment and Scoring System

#### **1. Define Database Schema**

1. **Design the "agents" Table**:
   - Define columns:
     - **Agent ID**: Primary key, unique identifier (integer or UUID).
     - **Agent Location**: Office location (string), with values such as North, South, or Midwest.
     - **Agent Score**: Integer or float representing the agent's performance score.

2. **Update Existing Database**:
   - Alter the existing database schema to include the new "agents" table.

#### **2. Generate Agents**

1. **Determine Number of Agents**:
   - Decide on the total number of agents needed for the system.

2. **Populate Agents Database**:
   - Create agent records with unique IDs.
   - Assign each agent a location from the predefined options (North, South, Midwest).
   - Initialize the agent scores to zero.

#### **3. Randomly Assign Leads**

1. **Retrieve Lead Data**:
   - Access the existing lead data from the leads database.

2. **Randomization Logic**:
   - Implement logic to randomly select leads for each agent, ensuring each agent receives 50 leads.

3. **Assignment Process**:
   - Assign leads to agents in a manner that all leads are distributed without duplication.
   - Track which leads have been assigned to ensure completeness.

#### **4. Develop Scoring Mechanism**

1. **Define Scoring Criteria**:
   - **Worked Leads**: Leads with a “worked” status contribute positively to the score.
   - **Urgent Leads**: Leads classified as “urgent” contribute negatively to the score.

2. **Calculate Initial Scores**:
   - For each agent, calculate the score based on the number of worked and urgent leads assigned.
   - Use the defined formula to update the agent’s score.

3. **Update Scores in Database**:
   - Save the calculated scores to the agent records in the database.

#### **5. Implement and Test**

1. **Code Implementation**:
   - Develop scripts or functions to handle the following:
     - Insertion of agent records into the database.
     - Random assignment of leads to agents.
     - Calculation and updating of agent scores.

2. **Testing**:
   - **Unit Testing**: Test individual components like lead assignment and score calculation functions.
   - **Integration Testing**: Ensure that the new system integrates smoothly with existing components and performs as expected.

3. **Validation**:
   - Verify that each agent has exactly 50 leads.
   - Check that scores are calculated correctly and updated in the database.

#### **6. Documentation and Deployment**

1. **Update Documentation**:
   - Document the new database schema, including the "agents" table.
   - Provide details on the lead assignment logic and scoring mechanism.
   - Include instructions for deployment, execution, and validation.

2. **Deploy Changes**:
   - Apply the schema changes to the production database.
   - Run the lead assignment and scoring scripts to populate the database with current data.

3. **User Training** (if applicable):
   - Provide training or documentation to users on how to interpret agent scores and manage assignments.

#### **7. Future Considerations**

1. **Scalability**:
   - Assess the system’s scalability if the number of agents or leads increases.

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Consider adding features such as dynamic scoring adjustments or more detailed agent performance reports.

3. **Feedback and Iteration**:
   - Collect feedback on the system’s performance and make iterative improvements as needed.

By following these steps, you will implement a robust system for managing agents and their lead assignments, complete with a scoring mechanism that reflects their performance.
